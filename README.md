# Project Description:
This is an experimental project based on the Style GAN model with adaptive discriminator augmentation(ADA) implemented by Nvida on lower resolution image data set. Original GitHub link: https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2
The major goal of this project is test effectiveness of ADA in restricted training data(5000 samples) and low-resolution(128*128 pixels). 

## Pretrained Networks:
Pretrained models are shared in the following Google Drive Folder.
